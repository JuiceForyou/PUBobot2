Some quick info about files important to the changes made for TF2 Pride Pugs 



GENERAL INFO
- I haven't updated the TODO yet
- start with the command: py PUBobot2.py


bot\match\match.py 
- Defines each "Match"
- A Match has a players list which contains all the players, as well teams where teams[2] is the unpicked players
- Appears to be a new Match every time the queue fills up
- New function init_immune() 
- - Sets the value of "immune" which is a list of player ids
- - Sorts the Match's player list randomly, with IMMUNEs at the end (does not sort the teams[2] list)


bot\match\embeds.py
- Handles the printing of messages to discord, but also has some logic to manipulate the data before/after printing
- Added extra content to
- - draft() printout at "Unpicked" stage (Mention, Division, Immune status, etc) and sorting 
- - check_in() printout contains random shuffle of the "not_ready" list (so that it is not in the same order as the "players" list, which would let people know who rolled captain at check-in)


bot\stats\stats.py
- Handles the read/write of stats to database
- Also creates a lot of the database tables
- The database table I have modified is 'qc_player_matches`, I added the 'captain' column
- This is where I have added the function get_immune_players() to return a list of player ids in the current match who are immune


bot\queues\pickup_queue.py
- This contains the variables for the Queue which can be set via the discord command `/queue set <queue> <var_name> <val>`
- I've added a variable captain_immunity_games


core\utils.py
- Contains some useful utility functions
- I've added a few such as get_div_role() to quickly return a player's division, as well as other similar functions

ISSUES / TODO


- Teams list to put players on new line, as the extra info in the printout is distracting OR remove all the Classes/Divs once a player is on a team

- Unpicked list sorted itself after only 1 captain had joined? (seems fine, further testing required)



- Edit draft printout to make it more obvious that the top 2 players in list need to captain (when bot is 100% tested we can auto select captains)



DONE

- Player list probably doesn't need the Mention + nickname + Class list. Just the Mention + Div is likely enough, if the other info is needed then you can just click the Mention
- Add IMMUNE count (eg IMMUNE x2 if they are immune for next 2 games)
